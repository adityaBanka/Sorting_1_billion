The "All-single.py" file is a starter code that contains implementation for Bubble sort, Selection sort, Merge sort, and Quick sort as well as basic performance timing code.

The "QS_Single.c" file contains code to run Quick sort directly but using C.

The 'QS-Multi.c" file is where the magic begins, the program usilizes shared memeory to create space for as many integers the user desires and then spawns around 32 processes to sort all elements radically fast. It also includes code to time the same. This also requires the creation of the 'shmfile.dat' file by the programmer.
